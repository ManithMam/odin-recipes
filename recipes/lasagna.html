        <li>25g/1/8 cups plain flour</li>
        <li>250ml/8.45fl oz Milk</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beef lasagna recipe starts with the most important step – making the soffrito! This is the key to a tastier filling so add a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil to a large pot and let it slowly heat.</li>
        <li>Next, add the chopped up carrot, celery and onion and leave to cook for 5-10 minutes or until it has started to soften.</li>
        <li>Add the mincemeat to your pot and break it down using a wooden spoon while it starts to brown. Leave to simmer and stir every so often until it has started to brown.</li>
        <li>Once the mincemeat for your beef lasagna has browned, add the glass of red wine and stir through with a wooden spoon. Leave this to simmer until it evaporates remembering to stir every so often.</li>
        <li>Add 1 ½ bottles passata and stir through. Make sure the stove is on a medium-low heat, then cover the pot and let simmer for one hour.</li>
        <li>Go back to the pot every now and then and stir the sauce using a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>After one hour, remove the lid and you will notice the tomato has reduced. Add one glass of water at this point and let cook on a low heat. Add more water if you believe it has dried up too much otherwise leave as it is.</li>
        <li>The sauce needs another hour to cook with the lid off. Remember to stir it!
        </li>
        <li>Next, the béchamel! Put the small saucepan on your stove at a low heat and add butter.
        </li>
        <li>Leave to melt slowly then add flour and quickly stir using a whisk. Keep doing this until the flour has disappeared.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the milk (around 1/4 at first) and don’t stop stirring! Continue adding the milk and stirring – be gentle yet firm. This will avoid it from sticking to the bottom and also from forming lumps.
        </li>
        <li>The sauce should start to become creamy and thick – stop once you have reached your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Turn off the stove and add a sprinkle of salt and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Line the baking tray with extra virgin olive oil or melted butter, using a pastry brush.</li>
        <li>Adjust the size of the lasagna sheets according to your dish so they fit nicely just by cutting them to size.</li>
        <li>Add a scoop of beef lasagna sauce to the bottom of the try and spread it all over, before laying down the first layer of lasagna sheets.
        </li>
        <li>Next scoop more sauce over the top of the pasta and spread it (using the bottom of a tablespoon or a wooden one) before sprinkling pecorino/parmigiano cheese on top, then add provolone and fresh mozzarella (your desired amount).
        </li>
        <li>Add some béchamel – not too much and spread it slightly.</li>
        <li>Add another layer of pasta sheets then repeat step 17 until you create the number of layers you wish – I aim for 5-6!</li>
        <li>Add plain basil tomato sauce on top, spreading it all over, edge to edge and in each corner too.</li>
        <li>Coverv the beef lasagna with foil and place in a pre-heated oven for 20 minutes at 180°C/350°F (fan forced).</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and take the foil off, before adding a generous sprinkle (all over) of pecorino/parmigiano cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven again (no foil) for another 10 minutes then remove and let cool.
        </li>
    </ol>
